      PageSpeed offers three "levels" to simplify configuration: PassThrough,
      CoreFilters, and OptimizeForBandwidth. The CoreFilters set contains
      filters that the PageSpeed team believes are safe for most web sites.
      By using the CoreFilters set, as PageSpeed is updated with new filters,
      your site will get faster. The OptimizeForBandwidth setting provides a
      stronger guarantee of safety and is suitable as a default setting for use
      with sites that are not aware of PageSpeed.

  LearningMode:

      Start Naxsi in learning mode. This means that no request will actually
      be blocked. Only security exceptions will be raised in the Nginx error
      log. Such a non-blocking initial behavior is important because the default
      rules are rather aggressive. Later, based on these exceptions, we will
      create whitelist for legitimate traffic.
